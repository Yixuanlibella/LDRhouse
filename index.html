  <div id="poem">
    <p>In the streets where the neon hums and the steel girders sing, I wander through the skid row, where dreams are abandoned like cigarette butts, crushed under boots of those who forgot what it means to be free,</p>
    <p>diamonds lost in the cracks of the pavement, the scent of liquor rising from the gutters,</p>
    <p>I scream in silence—we were all <button class="song-title" onclick="window.location.href='borntodie.html'">Born to Die</button>, but no one ever told us freedom was the real dream,</p>
    <p>and now we tear through the city like animals on fire, <button class="song-title" onclick="window.location.href='offtotheraces.html'">Off to the Races</button> with hearts pounding like war drums,</p>
    <p>my <button class="song-title" onclick="window.location.href='bluejeans.html'">Blue Jeans</button> clinging to my skin as I run, sweat dripping down my face,</p>
    <p>I drink down the night like <button class="song-title" onclick="window.location.href='dietmountaindew.html'">Diet Mountain Dew</button>, my heart captured by the wild beat of the <button class="song-title" onclick="window.location.href='nationalanthem.html'">National Anthem</button> blaring through the speakers of broken-down cars, a hymn for the fallen, for the lost,</p>
    <p>for the ones who see gods in the stars and monsters in the mirror.</p>

    <p>Haunted by the ghosts of what we could have been,</p>
    <p>I mutter to myself, "these <button class="song-title" onclick="window.location.href='videogames.html'">Video Games</button> don’t capture the blood and grit of reality,"</p>
    <p>there’s no truth in the pixels, no salvation in the digital ether.</p>
    <p>So I drift, ragged and aimless, through the endless night,</p>
    <p>wearing the tattered soul of <button class="song-title" onclick="window.location.href='carmen.html'">Carmen</button>, her voice whispering through alleyways,</p>
    <p>the Body Electric</button> crawling over my skin like an ancient memory waking up,</p>
    <p>I’m alive in this land of <button class="song-title" onclick="window.location.href='godsandmonsters.html'">Gods and Monsters</button>,</p>
    <p>alive but not whole, alive but not yet free,</p>
    <p>clutching my <button class="song-title" onclick="window.location.href='yayo.html'">Yayo</button> like it’s some kind of answer to the questions I can’t bear to ask.</p>

    <p>The streets are slick with <button class="song-title" onclick="window.location.href='cola.html'">Cola</button> and tears, freedom a mirage just out of reach,</p>
    <p>and I cry, but not for love, no, I cry for the <button class="song-title" onclick="window.location.href='american.html'">American</button> wildness,</p>
    <p>the raw and burning fire that lights up the darkness,</p>
    <p>I cry for my <button class="song-title" onclick="window.location.href='darkparadise.html'">Dark Paradise</button> where pain and freedom collide.</p>
    <p>Even in the heat of <button class="song-title" onclick="window.location.href='summertimesadness.html'">Summertime Sadness</button>, there’s a liberation,</p>
    <p>the feeling of breaking away from the weight of the world, of dancing in the rain,</p>
    <p>not knowing if tomorrow will ever come, but not caring, because tonight we are infinite.</p>

    <p>We ride, we ride, like <button class="song-title" onclick="window.location.href='milliondollarman.html'">Million Dollar Men</button> chasing the wind,</p>
    <p>not for fame or fortune, but for the thrill of it all, for the madness,</p>
    <p>for the burning desire that roars like a flame in our chests.</p>
    <p>We soar, we fall, but we rise again,</p>
    <p>our souls as light as the air in <button class="song-title" onclick="window.location.href='belair.html'">Bel Air</button>,</p>
    <p>where the breeze whispers of freedom we once dreamed but never grasped,</p>
    <p>and now we find it here, not in mansions or money,</p>
    <p>but in the fire in our veins, the freedom in our steps,</p>
    <p>we are the <button class="song-title" onclick="window.location.href='luckyones.html'">Lucky Ones</button>, not because of what we own,</p>
    <p>but because we are unchained, untamed, unstoppable.</p>
